I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your loving hand out, darlin'

Ridin' high, when I was king
I played it hard and fast, 'cause I had everything
I walked away, you want me then
But easy come and easy go
And it would end

So, any time I need ya, let me go
Yah, any time I feed you, get me? No
Any time I see you, let me know
But I planted that seed, just let me grow
