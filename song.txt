I'm on my knees while I'm beggin'
'Cause I don't want to lose you
Hey yeah, ratatata

I'm beggin', beggin' you
And put your loving hand out, baby
I'm beggin', beggin' you
And put your loving hand out, darlin'

I need you to understand
Tried so hard to be your man
The kind of man you want in the end
Only then can I begin to live again
